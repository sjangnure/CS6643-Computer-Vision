1. Implementation of Otsus Method for automatic thresholding
(This project was done as a part of CSGY 6643 course work Under Professor Edward Wong)
Project description: In the original Otusâ€™s method for automatic thresholding, we need to find
threshold t that minimizes the weighted sum of within-group variances.
